"In the last class, we discussed expressions like ax + b and learned how to solve them. Today, we are going to explore expressions like ax squared + bx + c, which are quadratic expressions."

"Let's start with the simplest quadratic expression: x squared."

"For x equals 0, the value is 0. For x equals 1, the value is 1. For x equals minus 1, the value is 1. For x equals 2, the value is 4. For x equals minus 2, the value is 4."

"If we plot these values on a graph with x-values on the x-axis and the values of the expression on the y-axis, we get a shape like this: y equals x squared. This shape of the curve is called a parabola."

"The point 0, 0 is called the vertex of the parabola. Now if we change the vertex of the parabola, the equation y equals x squared changes to y minus y sub-zero equals x minus x sub-zero squared."

"One of the most important techniques in dealing with quadratic expressions is factorizing them."

"A general quadratic expression, x squared + bx + c, can be written in the form: x + p times x + q, where p plus q equals b and p times q equals c."

"Consider the equation x squared + 5x + 6. We want to split the middle term into two parts such that their product is 6."

"Six equals one times six or two times three. We see that two plus three equals five. Hence, we can write the equation as x squared + 2x + 3x + 6. Taking out common factors, we get x times x + 2 plus 3 times x + 2. Factoring out x + 2, we get x + 2 times x + 3."

"Now, let's consider a more complex example. Eight x squared + 22x + 15."

"Before splitting, we multiply 15 by 8, getting 120. We then find pairs of factors of 120 that sum to 22. 10 times 12 equals 120 and sums to 22."

"Splitting the middle term, we write 8x squared + 12x + 10x + 15. Taking common factors, we get 4x times 2x + 3 plus 5 times 2x + 3. Factoring out 2x + 3, we get 2x + 3 times 4x + 5."

"Another method is completing the square."

"We use the identity: a plus b squared equals a squared plus 2ab plus b squared."

"Consider the expression x squared + 5x + 6. Write the middle term as 2 times 5 over 2 times x. Completing the square, we get x squared + 2 times 5 over 2 times x + 25 over 4 minus 25 over 4 plus 6. This equals x plus 5 over 2 squared minus 25 over 4 plus 24 over 4. Simplifying, we get x plus 5 over 2 squared minus 1 over 4, which factors to x plus 3 times x plus 2."

"While lengthy, this method always works and handles non-factorizable quadratics."
