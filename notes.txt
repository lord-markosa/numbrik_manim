real writing for the -1 = 1 demo

sqrt(a) sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab)

(-5)^2/3

a^x a>0 where x in R

x^(n/m) where (m, n) = 1 \\ie coprime and m is odd

(-1)^(1/3) == -1
but (-1)^(2/6) = write accordingly

z = a+ib  = re^(itheta)

any complex number z = a+ib  = re^(itheta)
can be written as this

Now when I can write -25 as 25*e^(i pi) = -25 times (cos(pi) + i sin(pi))

Now cos theta and sin theta are periodic functions with a period of 2*pi

cos(theta  +2pi) + isin(theta+2pi) is same as

25*e^(2n+1)pi ^2/3
